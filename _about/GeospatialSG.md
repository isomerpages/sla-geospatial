## The GeospatialSG Programme

Singapore's National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) was set up in 2008. Previously known as the Singapore Geospatial Collaborative Environment or SG-SPACE, the NSDI provides a mechanism to make authoritative geospatial data available for decision-making, public security and cost-effective businesses.

In 2018, SG-SPACE was reconceptualized to Geospatial Singapore (GeospatialSG), signifying the whole-of-nation approach to collectively maximize the use of geospatial information and technology for our Smart Nation and the Future Economy.

The GeospatialSG programme is co-driven by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), and the programme reports to the Government Data Steering Committee overseen by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office.
