<p></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 2 years
of virtual meetings, we are honoured to have you here with us. Welcome
to sunny Singapore, though the Singapore today is certainly hotter than
it was before, much like many other places across the world. It’s great
to see so many experts in the same space, physically. To our friends joining
online, a warm welcome as well and we hope to meet you in person soon,
one way or another.</p>
<p><em>Next Slide: Coastline from Airplane</em>
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To our international
guests who flew here, I am not sure how many of you noticed. As your plane
continued its descent towards Singapore Changi Airport, you could very
quickly visualise the shape of Singapore and our entire coastline.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 730 square
kilometres, land is extremely scarce in Singapore. Every square meter counts.
SLA’s vision of “Limited Land, Unlimited Space” is an apt description as
with competing needs, we almost need to be paranoid about land administration,
ensuring the best use of every square metre of usable area. Beyond the
2- dimensions (X &amp; Y), we need to explore the Z dimension, “stacking”
spaces over one another to create more usable spaces.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than having
limited land, we are also an island. In fact, 30% of Singapore’s land lies
less than 5m above current mean sea level. As such, climate change challenges
such as sea-level rise poses a real and existential threat to us.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help us manage
land effectively and to address climate change challenges, the Singapore
Digital Twin – or SG Digital Twin in short, encompassing 3D City models,
terrain models, cadastral information, underground assets, coastline, and
more, provides the foundation.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With SLA's National
3D Mapping programme, the entire island is captured digitally using laser
scanning and photogrammetry technologies from both the air and on land.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This creates a
digital twin that is used for effective land management and planning in
a number of initiatives which underpin sustainability efforts, in collaboration
with stakeholders.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>a. The digital twin helps to take stock of our natural capital such as
mangrove swamps, which serve as a carbon sink as well as the habitat for
more than 40 endangered species.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b. 3D building and terrain models help to create the Solar Potential map
which identifies the best sites for solar panels with the highest return
on investment. Otherwise, a blind proliferation of solar panels may instead
increase the urban heat island effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>c. In Keeping Singapore Cool, digital terrain &amp; buildings help to
study thermal comfort and the urban heat island effect in order to adapt
to climate change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>d. Deriving a map of Flood Inundation from the digital twin, we help to
quantify flood risks empirically and to protect against future flooding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signature
skyline of Singapore stands out in our Digital Twin. However, we may not
be able to continue building high-rises indefinitely.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we run
out of space, we will have to explore underground spaces to free up more
liveable spaces above ground for housing and recreational purposes.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain functions may be served
below ground. An example of this is the Jurong rock caverns, which frees
up 60 hectares or about 84 football fields for the storage of petrochemicals.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of data and maps for
utilities such as electricity, water and communications is notoriously
variable. Contractors who rely on inaccurate underground data often take
a “hit or miss” approach – all it takes is an excavation at the wrong location
to cut a “live” line, resulting in the blackout of entire districts.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the data is reliable
for better underground space planning, SLA is developing an ecosystem of
community, including data collection techniques, regulatory standards,
and Digital Twin of underground with 3D visualisation.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move from outdoors to interior
spaces, the use of LASER Scanning technology has become increasingly popular
for the creation of digital Building Information Model (BIM) and indoor
mapping. Whole-of-Government (WOG) agencies are working towards integrating
Geographic Information System (GIS) and BIM data for effective space management
and utilisation, supported by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In SLA, we are piloting Building
Information Model (BIM) technology for 3D Strata cadastral administration,
in high-rise communal living in order to take a 3D inventory of volumetric
spaces at the unit level, for each residential or commercial occupant.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SG Digital Twin also enables
more effective asset design, project execution and asset operation. By
leveraging on 3D datasets, spatial planning can take into account land
ownership, transport accessibility, service connectivity, safety concerns,
environmental considerations, and skyline aesthetics all at the same time.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public agencies can also review
the proposed digital designs simultaneously with a single coordinated approval.
Hence, it contributes towards the digital transformation of the AEC industry
and the built environment.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GeoSpace and OneMap 3D are platforms
that SLA provides to government agencies and the general public for curating
and sharing geospatial information. OneMap 3D allows the general public
to view maps and buildings in 3D, including simulated window views from
prospective homes.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, MPA hosted the first
International Seminar on United Nations’ Global Geospatial Information
Management, themed “Effective and Integrated Marine Geospatial Information
Management”. Leading international experts gathered to exchange their expertise
on global issues such as climate change, disaster risk management, and
integration of maritime, terrestrial, and cadastral geospatial information.
GeoSpace with land-based geodata and GeoSpace-Sea with marine-based geodata,
exchange layers of geospatial data in both directions, benefiting hydrographic,
land, and regulatory communities, removing barriers to effective spatial
management.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a lunch meeting a few months
back with Mr Hugh Lim of Centre for Liveable Cities (CLC), we discussed
the importance of geospatial solutioning in addressing challenges in cities.
In fact, many real world problems could potentially be solved with better
location enabled data. Location or geospatial knowledge plays an integral
role towards today’s socio-economic development. The question is how do
we create more awareness about geospatial. How do we make geospatial mainstream?</p>
<p>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s when Hugh very graciously
suggested having SLA to present the importance and benefits of geospatial
solutioning at the World Cities Summit. WCS, which is organised by CLC,
will be held in July this year and it will attract more than two thousand
(2000) leaders representing cities around the world who gather here to
innovate and improve lives of citizens worldwide.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SLA will be showcasing SG Digital
Twin in hope of raising awareness of location data's role in managing the
city among city leaders.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we are happy to have Hugh
Lim of CLC, to deliver the keynote address.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Singapore is an
island city state, a country and is a strong advocate of Smart Nation.
Perhaps Singapore can serve as a “Living lab” where ideas can be sandboxed,
test bedded etc and solutions may then be extrapolated and tailored to
other countries’ needs. SLA’s Geoworks serves as a sandbox for engagement
with potential industry partners, having collaborated with 21 companies
and 27 start-ups, thereby promoting geospatial innovation and competencies.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SG Digital Twin is a key enabler
of the United Nations’ visions of “closing the digital divide”, “leaving
no one behind”, and our aspirations to be a Smart Nation,</p>
<p>25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for Digital Twins to be
effective in managing land and tackling climate change challenges, different
stakeholders promoting openness and interoperability, such as UN Expert
Groups and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), public and private sectors
need to work together to contribute and integrate different sources of
geospatial information.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are honoured to host this UN-GGIM
event whose experts developed frameworks such as Integrated Geospatial
Information Framework (IGIF) and Framework for Effective Land Administration
(FELA) that embody their wisdom for effective land administration.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish all of you a fruitful seminar.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
