<p><strong>GeoWorks Launch on 16 July 2018</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<p>Distinguished Guests,
<br>
<br>Ladies and Gentlemen,
<br>
<br>I would like to congratulate SLA on the launch of GeoWorks.
<br>
<br>Today marks a milestone in our journey towards a Smart Nation. It signifies
a new era of collaboration - between the Government and industry, in driving
Singapore’s geospatial development.
<br>
<br><strong>Growing Importance of Geospatial Information and Technology</strong>
<br>
<br>Geospatial – or location-based information and technology – is becoming
increasingly important to leverage and drive businesses for the Government,
economy and society.
<br>
<br>It has wide applications, from everyday activities to government services.
<br>
<br>Geospatial underpins policy planning, operations and public service delivery
<br>
<br>For example:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>SCDF’s MyResponder app saves lives by notifying nearby volunteers of the
location of victims of cardiac arrest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MSO’s OneService app enables efficient resolution of municipal issues
using geo-tagged reports of incidents from citizens who spot something
that is not right.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Geospatial generates value and accelerates the growth of markets and the
economy.</p>
<p>
<br>Using geospatial, businesses optimise processes, create innovation, through
food delivery and taxi-booking apps, for example, Grab and Foodpanda.&nbsp;
In the logistics and transport sectors, geospatial optimises scheduling
and delivery routes.
<br>
<br>Geospatial also attracts strong global institutional attention. In 2017,
the United Nations (UN) and the World Bank signed a Memorandum of Understanding
to co-develop a geospatial framework for countries to reference when developing
their spatial data infrastructures.
<br>
<br><strong>Driving Geospatial Development in SG</strong>
<br>
<br>The team here has come a long way, since it first started its spatial
data infrastructure in 2008.
<br>
<br>Previously known as the SG-SPACE programme, it drove the development of
geospatial policies, technologies and human resources to manage and harness
the use of geospatial information and technology.
<br>
<br>Its outcomes included:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Adoption of ISO international data standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development of data-sharing platforms, GeoSpace and OneMap;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of capacity building initiatives, such as the Singapore
Geopatial Challenge and the Singapore Geospatial Scholarship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2018, SLA broadened SG-SPACE to Geospatial Singapore. This change signifies
a whole-of-nation approach towards geospatial development.</p>
<p>
<br>Under this new framework, SLA released the Singapore Geospatial Master
Plan earlier this month. It aims to galvanize the industry, different sectors
of the economy, government and citizens to maximize the value of geospatial
information and technology.
<br>
<br><strong>GeoWorks: A New Integrated Direction for SLA</strong>
<br>
<br>Under the Master Plan’s industry track, SLA aims to develop a thriving
geospatial industry.
<br>
<br>Using its geospatial expertise, government datasets and networks built
up over the years, SLA will:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Help Singaporeans benefit from geospatial information and technology;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foster a vibrant geospatial ecosystem -&nbsp; driving innovation, promoting
business opportunities and a well-connected community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of that has led to the establishment of GeoWorks.
<br>
<br>GeoWorks is a geospatial industry centre, with programmes to bring together
geospatial companies, sectoral users of geospatial technology, and government
agencies.
<br>
<br>Today, I am glad to learn that:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>17 geospatial partner companies (“GeoPartners”) have contributed to the
success of GeoWorks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>22 scale-ups (“GeoTechs”) have also made their home here.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They comprise both global and local scale-ups, looking to grow their business
in Singapore and the region. Many are here today to showcase their noteworthy
solutions.</p>
<p>
<br>GeoWorks will support these companies by providing expertise, resources
and business opportunities.
<br>
<br>For example, SLA, together with the Singapore Logistics Association and
the SUSS, co-organized the Supply Chain Challenge++ in May. Over 3 months,
students and industry players developed solutions to address challenges
faced by 5 locals SMEs in the logistic sector. GeoWorks will organise more
such challenges to further support industry innovation and SMEs’ digitalization
efforts, marrying industry players with solutions.
<br>
<br>Another example – GeoWorks supports the scale-up SpaceTravel to promote
social inclusiveness, by pioneering barrier-free routing services for the
disabled.
<br>
<br>GeoWorks will grow by engaging regionally, building up new networks, new
partnerships and new capacity.
<br>
<br>The MOUs we sign today with StarHub and the Action Community for Entrepreneurship
represent this broad step.
<br>
<br>Our young are also a source of talent and inspiration. We are awarding
the Singapore Geospatial Scholarship to a bright individual today. We are
confident that he will contribute to the geospatial sector.
<br>
<br><strong>Conclusion</strong>
<br>
<br>I am confident that SLA will continue its efforts in developing our talent
pool and take GeoWorks to greater heights.
<br>
<br>I wish GeoWorks and its members all the best in its future endeavours.
<br>
<br>Thank you.</p>
