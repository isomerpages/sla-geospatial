<p><strong>Launch of the Inaugural Singapore Geospatial Week and GeoWork's First Anniversary Celebration on 2 September 2019</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<p>Mr Lim Sim Seng, Chairman of the Singapore Land Authority</p>
<p>Distinguished Guests</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thank you for inviting me to join you here today.</p>
<p><strong>Inaugural Singapore Geospatial Week</strong>
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is the inaugural Singapore Geospatial Week, and geospatial - or location-based
information and technology - has become an integral part of Singapore’s
society, and a key enabler of our Smart Nation initiative.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Public agencies use geospatial technology to improve policy planning, operations
and service delivery. For example, the Municipal Services Office’s OneService
app is a one-stop platform for citizens to geotag and report issues to
relevant agencies quickly and conveniently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Businesses use geospatial technology to optimise processes and create innovative
offerings for their customers. So for example, Grab performs real-time
analysis of geospatial data to better match its drivers with passengers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Citizens also use geospatial technology in their daily lives. It encompasses
the familiar navigation devices to locate facilities and amenities, lifestyle
and entertainment options.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The rapid advances in geospatial technology will deepen its impact across
our economy and society. We need to accelerate awareness and deepen capabilities
to harness the value of geospatial technology for Singapore.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is the impetus for the inaugural Singapore Geospatial Week.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am very pleased to note that SLA has arranged a series of exciting events
for industry specialists, developers and enthusiasts to share and learn
about the various possibilities of geospatial technology. This includes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The ability to join more than 500 professionals and decision makers at
the ESRI Singapore User Conference – the largest event showcasing geospatial
achievements across a wide range of industries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can also attend the first Regional Geospatial Youth Forum to hear what
young professionals and students have to offer through their works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Or you can participate in the various interactive workshops such as “Create
Your Own Maps”, “Creating and Validating Crowdsourced Data” and “OneMap
Community” to learn new things.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So I am sure that you will have a very fruitful week ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Celebrating the First Anniversary of GeoWorks</strong>
</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Today, we also mark the first-year anniversary of GeoWorks.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
GeoWorks was established by SLA in 2018. As South East Asia’s first geospatial
industry centre, GeoWorks brings public agencies and private companies
together to promote business growth, drive innovation and foster a well-connected
geospatial community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>To date, 21 companies (or “GeoPartners” as we like to refer to them) and 27 start-ups (or “GeoTechs”) are part of the GeoWorks community. Together, GeoWorks has organised more than 280 events over the past year, ranging from business seminars, workshops to industry events.</strong>
</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GeoWorks
has catalysed several co-creation and collaboration projects.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two of our GeoTechs, AirMap and Garuda, are co-developing a proof-of-concept
for Singapore’s first connected urban airspace management system to enable
a single framework for managing, authorising and tracking large numbers
of unmanned aircraft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Grab, one of our GeoPartners, will also be organising a mapathon to engage
citizens in mapping wheelchair-accessible routes to enhance mobility and
accessibility for the physically-challenged.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this
note, I am pleased to share with you two new initiatives by SLA.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
OneMap was launched by SLA in 2010 as an integrated map system for public
agencies to deliver geospatial services and information.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SLA has partnered FourSquare to enhance OneMap with geospatial data from the private sector. Through this partnership, users will be able to find food and beverage stores, supermarkets and other lifestyle locations, in addition to the existing childcare centres, schools, and government buildings.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>SLA is also upgrading OneMap from 2D to 3D. With this upgrade, users will be able to navigate themselves in a 3D representation of the real world, i.e. around landmarks, walkways and even void deck spaces. OneMap3D will first be launched to developers by the end of 2020, and to the public on PC browsers and mobile devices subsequently.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should
also say that GeoWorks lends itself to the initiative that we have called
SG Together, because SG Together is really a new form of governance – of
people working together with government, and vice versa – to collaborate
and create new things. Listening to the list of things that you have done,
I would say that GeoWorks, in terms of what it does, lends itself very
well to SG Together. Because we can then tap on what the Government can
bring, as well as the ideas, energy and creativity of the private sector.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So with
that, let me just end by saying that geospatial information and technology
is critical to Singapore’s economic and social development, as we continue
our Smart Nation journey.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through
strong partnerships and collaborations, I am confident that SLA and GeoWorks
will continue to take our geospatial community to greater heights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish
you all the very best, and have a great GeoWorks gathering!</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank
you.&nbsp;</p>
