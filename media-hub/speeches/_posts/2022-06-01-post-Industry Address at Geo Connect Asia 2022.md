<p><strong>Geo Connect Asia 2022 on 1 June 2022</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A very good morning to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Our Guest-of-Honour, Mr. Edwin Tong, Minister for
Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;His Excellency, Ngy Chanphal, Secretary of State
of the Ministry of Interior, Cambodia,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Chia Ngiang Hong, President of Real Estate Developers'
Association of Singapore (REDAS), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Distinguished guests attending Geo Connect Asia 2022</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Recently, the re-opening of borders and hybrid working
arrangements have allowed us to resume international travel and reconnect
with friends and colleagues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, this conference, one of the first few hybrid
events since Singapore’s reopening, marks a shift to a new normal and the
geospatial industry’s aspiration to push boundaries as we transition to
a post-pandemic era.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Making Geospatial Mainstream</strong>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Today, emerging trends and digital transformation
are driving geospatial into the mainstream. Rich location-based data has
become integral to our daily lives. Through Singapore’s open map platform
OneMap, potential homebuyers can easily view nearby amenities such as parks,
shopping malls and even check the latest transacted property prices. For
parents, there is a school query function on OneMap that allows a quick
view of all primary schools nearby. For cyclists, OneMap is not only able
to suggest cycling routes, but safer routes, that make use of our local
park connectors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Geospatial will underpin Singapore’s ambition to
be a Smart Nation. Being both an island city state and a country, Singapore
could serve as a “Living Lab” where ideas can be test-bedded and solutions
adapted for other countries. SLA’s GeoWorks is the go-to sandbox for such
experimentations and collaborations, serving as an industry centre and
as a launchpad to the region.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Geospatial is important in supporting Singapore’s
transformation into a greener and more sustainable city. OneMap, as our
national map, is well-placed to be the Green Map for Singapore. For example,
solar potential, accessibility to green spaces and the network of EV charging
points could be mapped onto OneMap. The possibilities are only limited
by our imagination.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Expanding the Benefits of Geospatial into Real Estate</strong>
</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As the geospatial agency of Singapore, SLA remains
committed in expanding the use of geospatial through collaborations with
the industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the past few months, SLA has signed MOUs with
the top 5 real estate agencies in Singapore that represent more than 80%
of market share. SLA is working with these real estate agencies to collect
hyperlocal data through a geospatial application that harnesses GeoAI.</p>
<p></p>
<p>9,&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With this collaboration, property agents would benefit
from the integration of hyperlocal data on their own platforms. This will
help them serve their clients better with detailed location information
and nearby points of interest. Consumers looking to buy, sell or rent property
could benefit from the enriched data to make a more informed decision.</p>
<p></p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Today, we are signing an MOU with the Real Estate
Developers’ Association of Singapore (REDAS) to explore and collaborate
on geospatial solutions in the real estate and related industries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Looking ahead, we can potentially work with developers
to place 3D models of their newly launched projects on OneMap to showcase
a more dynamic representation of properties, with window-views and shadow
casting.</p>
<p></p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The mainstreaming of geospatial and cross-sector
collaborations is a testament to a vibrant and progressive geospatial industry.
For that, I would like to thank the President of REDAS, Mr. Chia, and our
partners, for supporting this shared vision.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Metaverse is the Next Big Opportunity in Geospatial</strong>
</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Now, significant developments in digital transformation
have empowered cities to look ahead and plant seeds for a metaverse ecosystem.</p>
<p></p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For me, the metaverse is a series of connected virtual
environments, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical
and digital worlds. Many businesses and enterprises are now exploring metaverse-based
fundamentals such as digital twins to synchronize these realities. The
metaverse may transform the way we socialize, work and play, and I am confident
that the geospatial industry is ready to seize new opportunities in the
metaverse ecosystem.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Closing Statement</strong>
</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to leave you with a quote from Bill
Gates, who said "Innovation is the most powerful force for change in the
world."</p>
<p></p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The value of geospatial is more apparent than ever
before. By coming together as a geospatial ecosystem, I believe our co-innovations
and our partnerships will collectively shape the next bound of our common
geospatial future.&nbsp;I hope this conference will allow you the space
and time to reflect and exchange ideas on how we can bring forward geospatial
development in the coming months and years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On this note, I wish everyone a fruitful conference
ahead. Thank you.</p>
<p>
