<p><strong>Welcome Remarks by Mr Colin Low, Chief Executive of SLA, at the Joint Opening of the Singapore Geospatial Festival 2023 &amp; the Open Geospatial Consortium Member Meeting at Lifelong Learning Institute on 26 September 2023 (Tuesday)</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Opening</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dr. Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman, Minister, Prime Minister's Office, Second
Minister for Education and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs,</p>
<p>Professor Aaron Thean, Deputy President (Academic Affairs) and Provost,
National University of Singapore,</p>
<p>Mr. Scott Simmons, Chief Standards Officer, Open Geospatial Consortium,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Distinguished guests,</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very warm welcome to all of you to the joint
opening of the Singapore Geospatial Festival 2023 and the 127th&nbsp;Open
Geospatial Consortium Member Meeting.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to say that this year marks the fifth
year SLA is organising GeoFest. Every year, we host GeoFest as part of
our efforts to raise awareness of all things geospatial-related. I hope
that I will continue to see everyone gather at GeoFest for many more years
to come.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Enriching Minds, Empowering Lives</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the theme of GeoFest is “enriching
minds, empowering lives”.&nbsp;There are two parts to this theme.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, ‘<u>enriching minds</u>’. Over the past
ten years, I am sure that all of us have observed a clear surge in the
usage of geospatial data, information, and technology. To meet this growing
demand, it is therefore crucial to build a talent pipeline to nurture national
geospatial capabilities.&nbsp;There is a saying that ‘learning never ends’,
which I fully agree with. Geospatial-related content must be included across
the full spectrum of the education journey, from our youth to working professionals.
Here at SLA, we have been actively working towards this goal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin with our geospatial initiatives
aimed at primary school children. Since 1982, the Science Centre Board
has encouraged primary school students to engage in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (‘STEM’) learning beyond the classroom by
awarding kids with badges after they complete a set of relevant missions.
The badges cover traditional subjects like biology, chemistry, physics
– and now, geospatial. SLA first introduced the Young Geospatial Scientist
badge in collaboration with the Science Centre back in March 2021. Since
then, the programme has introduced thousands of primary school students
to the exciting world of geospatial. Through tasks such as learning to
read maps or locating nearby Points of Interest, our primary school children
are exposed to the topic of geospatial from as young as 9 years old.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For secondary school students, SLA supported
the Science Centre in this year’s Singapore Science and Engineering Fair
(‘SSEF’), in partnership with MOE and A*STAR. During the SSEF Public Visit
Day, students who visited SLA’s station were able to explore a replica
of Science Centre and Marina Bay Singapore through the virtual world of
Minecraft. Through such interactions, we aim to spark students’ interest
in geospatial and prompt them to consider the potential applications of
reality mapping for urban planning and sustainability.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, for junior college students, SLA will
be launching a new Map Our World programme in November this year in collaboration
with MOE, geospatial technology providers, and surveyors. Map Our World
is a holiday camp that will give junior college students a taste of life
as a geospatial and geomatics professional. During the camp, they will
have the opportunity to learn from GIS software vendors, surveying instrument
vendors and local practitioners.</p>
<p></p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For tertiary students, SLA will soon be launching
the ASEAN Geospatial Challenge 2024. The AGC is an annual competition that
challenges tertiary students to come up with geospatial solutions to meet
real life needs. Time after time, I have been amazed by the creativity
of students from the region – not just from Singapore, but across Southeast
Asia. Last year, we awarded top prizes to six winners from Indonesia, Singapore,
and the Philippines. The winning solutions ranged from volunteer management
systems to build cohesive and sustainable communities, to mobile apps that
improve crop production and irrigation development. From the sheer quality
and variety of submissions we receive from students every year, I can confidently
say that the future of geospatial in ASEAN is bright. Of course, we work
hand in hand with our close counterparts from the region to make the AGC
a success every year. Some of them are here with us today for their annual
ASEAN Geospatial Agencies’ meeting, held in conjunction with GeoFest. To
all our ASEAN friends in the room – welcome to Singapore, and I hope you
have a fruitful meeting this afternoon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, we have our adult learners.
As a nation who embraces life-long learning, geospatial education is equally
important for working professionals like you and me. Over our many engagements
and conversations with geospatial professionals in the past few years,
we realised that there is strong industry demand for adult geospatial education.
Today, I am happy to announce that SLA will sign an MOU with NUS to develop
geospatial professional certifications and courses for working adults.
These courses are tailored to professionals who are keen to acquire geospatial
skills, but who may not be able to afford the time or commitment that a
full-time degree demands. The first intake for the graduate certificate
in Applied GIS commenced their studies last month, and we hope to continue
expanding the course offerings in future. As I mentioned earlier, learning
never ends. Whether you are 9 or 39 years old, we want to equip you with
the skills necessary to succeed in your geospatial career.</p>
<p></p>
<p>10.&nbsp;The second part of our theme is ‘<u>empowering lives</u>’. Apart
from building up our national geospatial capabilities, geospatial is an
integral tool that can be used to improve and enhance our daily lives.
Take education, for instance. How many of us here learnt history through
rote memorisation? Do you still remember what you learnt? During my school
days, classes like history could sometimes be boring and ineffective since
we had to memorise numerous facts via written text. Recently, our junior
college and university students have found new ways of using geospatial
to make learning more exciting and immersive. Using SLA’s geospatial expertise
and resources from the National Heritage Board, students created immersive
trails that visualise historical monuments and heritage trails in both
2D and 3D. If you have the time, I highly encourage you to experience these
trails firsthand at the NHB exhibit. Rather than just reading sterile textbooks,
students can see and experience points of historical, social, or cultural
value for themselves. Such immersive learning has much potential – not
only for history, but also for subjects like geography, social studies,
and so on. Education can be brought to life by using geospatial as the
key to unlock this potential.</p>
<p></p>
<p>11.&nbsp;On top of this, SLA has partnered MOE closely to enhance MOE-EduGIS,
aimed at secondary school students. MOE-EduGIS is an educational platform
that utilises geospatial government data and ESRI products to produce and
deliver digital maps. School teachers can use these maps, which are easily
accessible via the national e-learning platform, for educational purposes.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank ESRI for their invaluable
help throughout the development of MOE-EduGIS. We are constantly improving
and upgrading the platform to elevate students’ learning experiences. During
their showcase later, we will hear from students from Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary
School on how the platform has helped them in the classroom. These are
just a few of the numerous ways that education can be made more interactive
and engaging through geospatial.</p>
<p></p>
<p>12.&nbsp;Of course, geospatial’s impact and potential are not limited
to education alone. Geospatial has demonstrated its immense value in our
everyday lives, whether it may be routing paths to the nearest neighbourhood
amenities or locating nearby ART kits during the pandemic.</p>
<p></p>
<p>13.&nbsp;To provide greater convenience and more useful map-based information
at your fingertips, I am pleased to announce that SLA will be launching
the OneMap GPT Challenge next month. This challenge will combine the latest
trending topic, AI, with geospatial technology. Imagine this – you are
planning the itinerary for your next Sunday outing with your family. You
might have grandparents who are not as mobile, and young kids who love
being active. How do you consider everything, everywhere, all at once?
Wouldn’t it be great if with a single click of a button, the ideal route
for your Sunday family day out could be generated on OneMap based on your
preferences? This could become reality soon through the OneMap GPT challenge,
where participants will be invited to come up with innovative solutions
to such problems. This challenge represents just the start of our AI journey.
SLA will continue to ride on the latest trends in technology to continue
improving and empowering lives through geospatial.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>OGC Member Meeting</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>14.&nbsp;In tandem with GeoFest, we are pleased to once again be hosting
the 127th&nbsp;Open Geospatial Consortium (‘OGC’) Member Meeting here in
Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>15.&nbsp;The OGC is dedicated to advancing the future of geospatial through
open standards and technologies. It is always an honour to host such an
experienced and accomplished community of experts with us in Singapore.
I hope everyone will make the most of this opportunity to interact and
learn from one another.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Closing</u></strong>
</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;The lineup for the week ahead is absolutely packed with talks,
workshops, and expert panels. You will be able to hear from not just geospatial
experts, but also from students starting out on their geospatial journeys.
No matter which stage of your geospatial journey you are at, there is something
for everyone at GeoFest 2023.</p>
<p></p>
<p>17.&nbsp;I hope these activities will be enriching and empowering for
all GeoFest attendees, and I wish everyone an enjoyable time in the days
ahead. Thank you.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>About “Map Our World” Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>In its inaugural year, the “Map Our World” programme would involve Year
1 Pre-University students from MOE’s Geography Talent Development Programme.
The programme will teach students about the fundamentals and importance
of mapping, geodata collection and map construction. Students will learn
from GIS software vendors, surveying instrument vendors and local practitioners,
and get a better idea of the career paths in this industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>ANNEX E</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>OneMap in MOE-EduGIS</strong>
</p>
<p>35 thematic layers from OneMap&nbsp;have&nbsp;been added to MOE-EduGIS,
a geographic information system that is deployed by the Ministry of Education
to support Geography learning. MOE-EduGIS is used by Geography teachers
to create curriculum-aligned digital map applications for classroom instruction
and student fieldwork. With the integration of these OneMap thematic layers,
teachers&nbsp;and students can now access selected OneMap content via MOE-EduGIS.
The available OneMap&nbsp;content now includes historic sites, tourist
attractions, dengue clusters, ABC water sites, parks, and nature reserves.
The availability of the new data enriches students’ discovery of people
and nature in Singapore, supporting their development of spatial awareness,
critical thinking, and problem solving. Moving forward, SLA will explore
the possibility of scaling up to integrate more OneMap thematic layers
in MOE-EduGIS.</p>
