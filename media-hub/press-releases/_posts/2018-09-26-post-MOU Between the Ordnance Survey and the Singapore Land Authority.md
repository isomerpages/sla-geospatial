<hr>
<p>A memorandum of understanding (MOU) was inked today between the Ordnance
Survey (OS) and the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) to drive geospatial
innovation in Singapore and the United Kingdom (UK).</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Managing Director
of Ordnance Survey International, Mr Peter Hedlund, and Singapore Land
Authority Director of Geospatial and Data, Mr Ng Siau Yong signed the MOU
which will see both organisations intensify focus on the promotion and
use of geospatial information to support smart services and solutions which
aim to benefit citizens, communities, business and government.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Building on the
current, longstanding and strong relationship between OS and SLA, the MOU
will support both parties in exploring new collaborations. For example,
the OS and SLA aim to jointly hold events between OS’ Geovation and SLA’s
GeoWorks, Singapore’s new geospatial industry centre for start-ups, companies
and interested communities in both the UK and Singapore. Over the past
decade, Geovation has grown to become the world’s leading incubator and
accelerator programme for startups looking to develop businesses using
location and land and property data. Another key focus of the MOU is the
co-development of a proposal for autonomous vehicles, exploring data capture,
data processing and standards.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordnance Survey
CEO Mr Neil Ackroyd said: “Within Singapore, we recognize the leading role
that the SLA has taken to drive geospatial transformation to power various
smart city projects. The MOU builds on an already excellent relationship
and will focus our work on strengthening the important role which geospatial
information can play in decision making, enabling tomorrow’s emerging technology
and markets, and delivering against the smart city agenda. I am interested
to see how the autonomous vehicle proposal develops. Within the UK, OS
is leading on a Government funded project to help shape a national infrastructure
capable of supporting a nationwide network of Connected and Autonomous
Vehicles.”</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MOU was signed
at the Open Geospatial Consortium’s Location Powers event in Singapore,
in the presence of the SLA Chief Executive, Mr Tan Boon Khai, the British
High Commissioner as well as Mr William Priest from the UK Government’s
Geospatial Commission.</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “As part of Singapore’s
Geospatial Masterplan, the SLA is taking a strategic lead to grow and foster
a collaborative geospatial ecosystem by partnering with the industry. This
memorandum of understanding will strengthen our ability to drive geospatial
innovation in Singapore and the UK in collaboration with the Ordnance Survey.
We look forward to share our knowledge in harnessing the potential of geospatial
information and technology with our global partners,” said SLA Chief Executive
Mr Tan Boon Khai.</p>
