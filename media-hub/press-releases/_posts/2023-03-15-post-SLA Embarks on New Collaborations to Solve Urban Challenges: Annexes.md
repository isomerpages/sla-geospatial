<p></p>
<p><strong>Welcome Remarks by Mr Yeoh Oon Jin, Chairman, Singapore Land Authority at the Opening of Geo Connect Asia at Sands Expo &amp; Convention Centre, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore on 15 March 2023 (Wednesday)</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
very good morning to:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
Guest-of-Honour, Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability
and the Environment and Senior Minister of State for Transport;</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr
Nadine Alameh, Chief Executive Officer, Open Geospatial Consortium;</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr
Asim Ibrahim Al-Ghamdi,&nbsp;Assistant President, General Authority for
Survey and Geospatial Information of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia;</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms
Ku Geok Boon, Chief Executive Officer, SG Enable;</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr
Ricky Loo, Deputy President,&nbsp;Container Depot and Logistics Association
of Singapore, and</p>
<p>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distinguished
guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome
to the opening of the Geo Connect Asia 2023. Our guests in the room today
come from many overseas countries and various industries, and we are very
glad to be able to host you in Singapore this week.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
the national geospatial agency, the Singapore Land Authority actively supports
the adoption of geospatial services and technologies. This is a collaborative
effort together with our esteemed partners, including those from various
industries that are here with us today.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Geospatial is Growing in Significance&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
Singapore, geospatial is growing in significance and importance. It is
being applied to support our social, economic and environmental development.
For example,</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Geospatial supports business transformation. We had recently signed MOUs
with the Singapore Business Federation, Real Estate Developers’ Association
of Singapore, Ninja Van, Kabam and the top 5 largest property agencies
in Singapore to drive geospatial adoption and innovation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geospatial is an enabler for sustainable development. SLA has partnered
research institutions to harness geospatial data for climate change studies.
Last year, SLA signed MOUs with the Earth Observatory of Singapore, and
the National University of Singapore’s Centre for Nature-based Climate
Solutions, to leverage on SLA’s geospatial capabilities for coastal protection
studies and carbon estimation research.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The Next Bound</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are just at the beginning of unleashing the full potential of geospatial.
Why stop at upstream planning as traditionally done? How can we use hyperlocal
maps to help persons with disabilities move around Singapore barrier-free?
How can we map peoples’ needs and provide targeted social assistance? Going
forward, we will continue to experiment on using geospatial datasets in
novel ways. We will deepen our own geospatial capabilities, broaden our
partnerships, and continue to mainstream geospatial in businesses as well
as in sustainable development.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
the same time, we will leverage on Singapore’s strength as a global hub
to generate more opportunities for the geospatial sector. Businesses can
take advantage of our well-established infrastructure, conducive business
environment and geospatial expertise, and use Singapore as a living lab
and launch-pad to the regional markets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
will continue to broaden our outreach efforts, establish more international
collaborations and strengthen our networks across the globe. By bringing
together geospatial experts and businesses from around the world to Singapore,
Geo Connect Asia is an excellent platform for us to make important connections
and create new opportunities.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Sharing Expertise beyond Singapore</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just
yesterday, we welcomed thought leaders from around the world to the International
Seminar on Geo-Enabled Effective Land Administration organised by SLA.
Singapore also contributes to international geospatial development by co-chairing
the UN’s Expert Group on Land Administration and Management, led by SLA’s
Dr Victor Khoo. We will continue to contribute our expertise to support
the global geospatial development agenda.</p>
<p></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
this note, I am happy to share that SLA will be entering into a collaboration
with Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for Survey and Geospatial Information
today, for SLA to contribute its expertise in geospatial development. We
are grateful to Saudi Arabia for supporting our shared vision to raise
geospatial capabilities globally, and we are excited about further possibilities
that will arise from this collaboration.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Closing</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am optimistic
that by working together and across business sectors and domains, we will
continue to make further strides in geospatial development in the coming
years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed,
I am very pleased to see the strong turn-out at the 3rd&nbsp;Geo Connect
Asia, which speaks volumes about the growing interest in the relevance
of geospatial applications in our daily lives. I am confident that you
will have many opportunities to exchange ideas and forge new partnerships
at this conference.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish
everyone a very fruitful conference ahead. Thank you.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Quotes from SLA and partners</strong>
</p>
<p>As the National Geospatial Agency, SLA is actively looking into how we
can “mainstream” geospatial data and technologies to increase their applications
so as to solve the urban challenges that cities face.&nbsp; These collaborations
with our partners show that geospatial innovations can solve many different
types of challenges and contribute to a more sustainable and inclusive
society.&nbsp; We are also very happy to be able to share our geospatial
knowledge and experiences with our overseas counterparts.&nbsp; SLA will
continue to raise awareness on geospatial developments, be it in sectors
such as sustainability, social services or education so that more can benefit
from the use of geospatial data and technology.</p>
<p>- <em>Mr Colin Low, Chief Executive, Singapore Land Authority</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Together with SLA, CDAS will help promote awareness in geospatial technologies
and their potential areas of application to further benefit our members
and the industry at large. To show our commitment to this, CDAS has integrated
OneMap as the map choice for the Container Tracking System (CTR) to not
just benefit the depots and hauliers of the logistics industry, but to
also expand on the capabilities of OneMap.</p>
<p>Working hand in hand, I am confident that SLA and CDAS will be able to
identify, and develop promising potential&nbsp;geospatial co-innovation&nbsp;projects,
and find solutions that will address the challenges faced by&nbsp;the logistics
and transportation industry, and bring it to greater heights.</p>
<p><em>- Mr Ricky Loo, Deputy President, Container Depot and Logistics Association (Singapore)</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>An accessible physical environment is key in enabling persons with disabilities
to live independently. SG Enable is excited to partner SLA on this pilot
project to identify barrier-free routes and enable navigation within the
selected areas. We hope to see more social innovations like this that contribute
towards a more inclusive commuting experience for persons with disabilities.</p>
<p><em>- Ms Ku Geok Boon,&nbsp;Chief Executive Officer,&nbsp;SG Enable</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a People’s Garden, Gardens by the Bay aims to be a place for one and
all in the community to gather, which is why universal accessibility has
always been part of our design approach since we opened our doors to the
public 10 years ago. We are pleased to be amongst the first to participate
in this pilot project collaboration with SLA, which upon completion, will
see Gardens by the Bay’s barrier-free access routes included in OneMap
as an additional wayfinding option for our visitors.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Mr Felix Loh, Chief Executive Officer, Gardens by the Bay</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I take this opportunity to welcome this cooperation between our friendly
nations.&nbsp;It is a great opportunity for our two organisations to share
their knowledge and experience and gives us an opportunity to benefit from
the Singaporean experience in&nbsp;geospatial information management. Via
this collaboration, we look forward to enhancing the operations of National
Geospatial Center, that is responsible for sharing of geospatial data,
products, solutions, and services in Saudi Arabia. We look forward to jointly
work together on establishing strong relationship with geospatial data
theme custodians, producers, and users to ensure the availability of timely
and useful geospatial information in an easy, safe, secure, and reliable
manner. We also look forward to working together to identify opportunities
in developing capabilities to enhance the&nbsp;Center.</p>

<p><strong>ANNEX D</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>ASEAN Geospatial Challenge 2023</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>ASEAN Geospatial Challenge 2023: Geospatial Youth Edition</em>&nbsp;brings
youth in the ASEAN region together to use geospatial technology and information
to support nations in achieving their Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Targeted at students from Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) in the ASEAN
region, the challenge aims to:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultivate
good relationships and collaborations among the youth in ASEAN;</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elevate
geospatial competencies and facilitate knowledge sharing;</p>
<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raise
interest in the geospatial field.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entries are submitted
by&nbsp;Geospatial Agencies from Indonesia (Badan Informasi Geospatial),
Philippines (National Mapping and Resource Information Authority) and Singapore
(Singapore Land Authority).</p>
<p></p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
total of 33 teams from 23 IHLs across three ASEAN countries participated
in the competition this year. Singapore fielded ten teams.&nbsp; Indonesia
fielded 21 teams. The Philippines sent two teams.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two winning teams of the
“Distinction Award” are from the Singapore Management University and Bandung
Institute of Technology, Indonesia. The synopses of the projects from the
teams are appended.</p>
<p><u>Singapore Management University</u>
</p>
<p>The team’s project aims to address the current challenges of connecting
people who need help or resources with those who can provide them. Recognising
that there has to be a way to connect these stakeholders based on location,
availability and nature of assistance easily and safely, the team has proposed
a mobile app to match Non-Profit Organisations with volunteers based on
location, availability and nature of assistance.&nbsp; The solution will&nbsp;better
connect volunteers with their beneficiaries to build cohesive and sustainable
communities.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia</u>
</p>
<p>The team’s project aims to provide information that will help users&nbsp;assess
land suitability for crop production and prioritise areas for irrigation.
The team has proposed a Geographic Information System (GIS) mobile app
that will leverage remote sensing datasets and machine learning to generate
models showing land suitability for agriculture,&nbsp;from the least suitable
to the most suitable. It will also show the areas that can be prioritised
for irrigation&nbsp;network development. The solution will contribute to
more effective and efficient agricultural policies, and increase the opportunities
for long-term investment.</p>
