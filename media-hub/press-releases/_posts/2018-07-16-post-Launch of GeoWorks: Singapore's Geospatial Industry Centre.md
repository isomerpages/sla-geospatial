<p>GeoWorks, an industry centre to promote geospatial innovation and competencies,
was officially launched today by Senior Minister of State for Law and Health,
Mr Edwin Tong. GeoWorks aims to connect businesses, entrepreneurs and innovators
to drive geospatial solutions for the promotion of business growth and
opportunities in Singapore.</p>
<p>Geospatial information and technology has the potential to transform policy
analysis, operations and service delivery, accelerate the growth of industries
and generate economic and social value for Singapore. Geospatial information
and technology helps support numerous applications across different sectors
and allows for real-time location-based services. For instance, geospatial
information from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is used in
autonomous vehicle trials and development, drone flight path planning and
even in remote sensing applications for day-to-day navigation and wayfinding.</p>
<p>“In the age of technological disruption, GeoWorks represents the Government’s
commitment to enhance the use of geospatial information and technology
to support digitalisation of our key industries, and to build up geospatial
capabilities in support of Singapore’s Smart Nation Initiative”, said Senior
Minister of State for Law and Health, Mr Edwin Tong.</p>
<p>GeoWorks was set up by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) in January 2018
as an initiative under the Singapore Geospatial Master Plan. SLA and the
Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) have jointly developed
the Geospatial Master Plan which sets out the vision, strategies and key
initiatives to facilitate geospatial transformation and to pave the way
towards a “Geospatial-Powered Singapore’. The aim of the Geospatial Master
Plan is to leverage emerging technologies and to build geospatial competencies
to address complex challenges and create opportunities. This is in line
with the Digital Government Blueprint’s strategy to raise Whole-of-Government’s
digital capabilities to pursue innovation, in support of Singapore’s Smart
Nation drive.</p>
<p>“Geospatial information has the tremendous potential to transform services,
streamline business processes and help companies gain competitive advantage
with geospatial data analytics. The launch of GeoWorks is timely as the
industry centre will be well-poised to contribute to the various growth
sectors in Singapore as well as to tap on other opportunities in Asia and
beyond,” SLA Chief Executive, Tan Boon Khai said.</p>
<p><strong>Growing the GeoWorks Community</strong>
</p>
<p>As an industry centre, GeoWorks will galvanise the geospatial industry
by reaching out to geospatial businesses, entrepreneurs and users, supporting
them with resources such as geospatial and government data, expertise and
access to networks and opportunities. The ultimate objective is to facilitate
the growth of a vibrant geospatial ecosystem, creating value through shared
knowledge, expertise and government data. The geospatial companies catalyse
geospatial innovation and solutions; while the corporate and government
end-users provide access to business opportunities. GeoWorks now hosts
22 GeoTech companies including ABJD, AirMap, NavInfo Data Tech and LDR
Technology.</p>
<p>ABJD cofounder and Chief Engineer Hazrul A Jamari said, “We are grateful
to be a part of the Geoworks community as we are able to tap on the expertise
and resources of the OneMap team to build our next generation Delivery
Management System (DMS) and Halalonclick app. With OneMap, we are able
to get authoritative and updated addresses so that we deliver accurately.
With the OneMap API, we could build a more robust DMS with better routing
so that our riders are able to get to their destinations on time.”</p>
<p>"We are excited to be partnering with SLA to progress geospatial innovation
in Singapore" said Ben Marcus, cofounder and Chairman of AirMap. "In our
experiences around the world, we’ve found that collaboration with government
and local stakeholders is key to achieving the full promise of drones and
drone technology."</p>
<p>Seventeen GeoPartners have also come onboard to support GeoWorks, including
Amazon Web Services, Autodesk and Esri. “Spatial digitalisation is essential
to many industries as it underpins all efforts geared towards Singapore
becoming a Smart Nation,” Thomas Pramotedham, CEO of Esri Singapore said.
“The launch of Geoworks will pave the way to the vibrant growth of Singapore’s
geospatial ecosystem, and we at Esri look forward to playing an active
role as one of their partners - driving innovation and helping more organisations
embrace a Smart City thinking perspective in using geospatial information
and technology to engineer our urban environments and in enhancing the
quality of life of our communities.”</p>
<p><strong>Sustaining a Geospatial Ecosystem</strong>
</p>
<p>To build up and sustain a geospatial ecosystem, regular challenges will
be conducted at GeoWorks to encourage the ideation and development of innovative
solutions to address challenge statements from user sectors, such as logistics,
transport and retail.</p>
<p>“Through GeoWorks, SLA will curate programmes and initiatives, including
mentorships and linkages with key industry stakeholders, to seed business
opportunities for geospatial start-ups, and jumpstart innovation in this
pioneering field. Ultimately, we are looking into developing and uplifting
skillsets and capabilities towards harnessing the potential of emerging
technologies to address complex challenges and opportunities,” Mr Tan added.</p>
