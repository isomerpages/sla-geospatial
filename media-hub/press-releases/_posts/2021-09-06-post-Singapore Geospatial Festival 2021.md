<p>Singapore Geospatial Festival 2021 (#SgGeoFest) returns for the third
consecutive year with a virtual line-up of geospatial events and interactive
activities. Presented by GeoWorks, Singapore’s geospatial industry centre
managed and operated by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA), #SgGeoFest
will run from today, 6 September, to 17 September 2021.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reaching an international audience
of geospatial industry experts, young professionals, students and enthusiasts,
#SgGeoFest combines a series of over 70 webinars, workshops and talks as
a knowledge-sharing forum on topics ranging from digital twins and innovation
in maps, to catalysts for earth observation for business and educational
exchange.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The line-up of the activities organised
during Singapore Geospatial Festival 2021 is available at the event website
at <a href="http://go.gov.sg/sggeofest" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go.gov.sg/sggeofest</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SLA chief executive Colin Low said,
“The pandemic has fast-tracked Digital Transformation across the world,
and geospatial technology has proven itself as a powerful took in helping
us navigate a new way of life. Beyond developing geospatial technology
and infrastructure, we are strengthening capabilities and cultivating talents
towards a collaborative, adaptive and diverse geospatial ecosystem. This
year’s #SgGeoFest will see a comprehensive line-up to build geospatial
interest across new segments to reach special interest groups and even
young students. It will be a chance to meet geospatial partners from around
the world, to learn about their latest innovations, from creating Digital
Twins for sustainable city planning, to using Augmented Reality for natural
disaster response efforts.”

<p><strong><em>#SgGeoFest Highlights</em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>International geospatial knowledge sharing</strong>
</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>GeoMarketplace: Meet GeoTechs from Around the World</em>&nbsp;is
presented as a discussion to promote geospatial sharing across borders
for industry professionals, featuring startups and scale-ups showcasing
their geospatial innovation. GeoWorks’ international community partners
and members from Finland, Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, India, Japan, South
Korea, The Netherlands, United Kingdom and the United States of America
will also share about geospatial developments in their countries and regions.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Open Geospatial Consortium
120th Member Meeting will be co-hosted by SLA at #SgGeoFest this year,
marking the start of a 3-year collaboration for the meeting to be held
in Singapore. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) boasts an international
community of experts focused on open standards and innovation through interoperable
geospatial technologies. #SgGeoFest attendees can register to attend OGC’s
meetings including, but not limited to, the Open Plenary, Asia Forum, OGC
startups presentation, and Today's Innovations, Tomorrow's Technologies,
Future Directions. “OGC is very pleased to collaborate with SLA on advancing
geospatial technology and best practices in the Asia-Pacific region and
beyond.&nbsp;We will join hands&nbsp;in&nbsp;establishing a number&nbsp;of
industry&nbsp;events in the coming years&nbsp;to benefit the professional
geospatial community in this region, starting with this year’s Singapore
Geospatial Festival,” said Scott Simmons, chief standards officer of OGC.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GeoWorks’ GeoPartners and members,
including Autodesk, Dassault Systemes, Esri, Hexagon, Geo Connect Asia,
PTV Group, Synspective and Trimble, will also contribute to the line-up
for #SgGeoFest with virtual conferences to update on use cases and applications
across various sectors.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Developing geospatial interest in the young</strong>
</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To develop young talents, SLA will
present the annual Regional Geospatial Youth Forum on 16 September as part
of #SgGeoFest to build geospatial interest and awareness among young professionals
and students from Singapore and participating ASEAN countries and regions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SLA will also co-host the&nbsp;Young
Geospatial Scientist workshop with Science Centre Singapore to develop
geospatial knowledge among school children. The Young Geospatial Scientist
Badge programme is a collaboration between SLA and Science Centre Singapore.
Launched in March 2021, it has since been accessed by almost 2,000 students.
“Today’s youths are tomorrow’s leaders. There is no question that youths
are guardians of our planet’s future and have an extremely important role
in our journey forward. In this world of rapid changes, young people need
to develop a greater breadth of skills to thrive. Geospatial is a field
that explores the connections between the community and the environment
that can go a long way to help create and design meaningful solutions.
We are proud to be partnering with SLA to expand our suite of ‘I Am A Young
Scientist’ badges and continue advocating for the self-exploration of new
technologies to unleash limitless possibilities,” said Professor Lim Tit
Meng, chief executive of Science Centre Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>SLA’s 20th Anniversary Special: Geospatial data for heritage research and navigational safety&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conjunction with SLA’s 20th Anniversary,
a series of talks is presented to showcase the use of maps, location intelligence
and spatial history in heritage archival research as well as safety management
for the community. “Often times, old maps present information on site planning
and can serve as a guide to looking into the background and history of
a place of significance,” said heritage researcher Jerome Lim, who will
be facilitating a virtual visit and presenting on the role of the Old Kallang
Airport in Singapore’s aviation history. Old Kallang Airport is a State
property managed by SLA.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other highlights of this series include
a review of the works of John Turnbull Thomson, Government Surveyor of
the Straits Settlements from 1841 to 1855, by mapping consultant Mok Ly
Yng; a discussion on the use of ephemera to better understand the narrative
of places and buildings by architect Dr Lai Chee Kien; and an interpretation
of past addresses, and colonial names of streets and places, in an ongoing
study of Singapore’s heritage by&nbsp; the National Heritage Board’s researcher
Ng Ching Huei.</p>
<p></p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geospatial data is also used as a navigational
tool to address mobility issues faced by the elderly and wheelchair users.&nbsp;<em>Mapping our town with OneMap</em>&nbsp;is
presented by Wee Kit Bian, chief enabling officer of <a href="http://BLK.SG" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BLK.SG</a>, as
a project to teach users how to use Interactive <a href="http://OneMap.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OneMap.sg</a> to find barrier-free routes or covered
linkways for greater travelling ease.&nbsp;</p>
