<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Singapore Land Authority (SLA)
is embarking on various new collaborations to solve urban challenges by
tapping on the possibilities offered by geospatial technology to facilitate
data-driven decision making and solutions. Geospatial technology refers
to location-based technology which is a key enabler in supporting Singapore’s
Smart Nation and sustainability initiatives and is commonly used in areas
such as mapping and road navigation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new collaborations were
announced by&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Sustainability
and the Environment, and Ministry of Transport, at the opening of the Geo
Connect Asia 2023&nbsp;on 15 March 2023. At the event,&nbsp;Dr Khor also
witnessed the signing ceremonies for two of SLA’s collaborations - with
the&nbsp;Container Depot and Logistics Association (Singapore), and the
General Authority for Survey and Geospatial Information of the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia.&nbsp;&nbsp;Geo Connect Asia 2023 is&nbsp;an annual international
geospatial industry event. Supported by the Singapore Land Authority as
the National Geospatial Agency, the event is held from 15 to 16 March 2023
at the Sands Expo &amp; Convention Centre, Marina Bay Sands.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please
refer to&nbsp;<u>Annex A</u>&nbsp;for the welcome remarks by Mr Yeoh Oon
Jin, Chairman of SLA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Memorandum of Understanding with&nbsp;Container Depot and Logistics Association (Singapore)</em></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its latest collaboration
with the industry, SLA will collaborate with the Container Depot and Logistics
Association (Singapore) or CDAS, to improve the routing of heavy vehicles.
A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed by Mr Sin Lye Chong, Assistant
Chief Executive&nbsp;(Geospatial &amp; Engagement) and Chief Sustainability
Officer&nbsp;of SLA, and Mr Ricky Loo, Deputy President of CDAS. Under&nbsp;the
two-year collaboration, CDAS and SLA will utilise geospatial data such
as road conditions and restrictions to enable the CDAS's member companies
to route their heavy vehicles efficiently and safely.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With more comprehensive data,&nbsp;companies
that deploy such vehicles and their drivers will be able to plan their
journeys better and save time. This will translate&nbsp;into cost savings
for the companies as they use less fuel, and also lower their carbon emissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Collaboration to Improve Accessibility</em></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SLA’s geospatial collaborations
go beyond working with the industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;SLA has also been working
with SG Enable and Gardens by the Bay to map barrier-free routes to enable
wheelchair users to move about easily. This collaboration is part of SLA’s
support for the Enabling Masterplan 2030 which sets out the vision for
Singapore as an inclusive society by 2030.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this initiative, data
relating to routes that are barrier-free such as those with&nbsp;wheelchair-accessible
covered linkways, ramps, footpaths, pedestrian crossings, overhead bridges
with lifts are collected and mapped in Bukit Merah and Gardens by the Bay.<em>&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SLA has developed a pilot
testing app with the barrier-free access routes for these two areas to
gather feedback and suggestions for improvements from wheelchair users.
Improvements in terms of data accuracy and user-friendliness will be incorporated
in additional testing areas in the next six months.&nbsp; Eventually, the
barrier-free access routing function will be added to OneMap as an additional
mode of wayfinding, to supplement the existing public transport, cycling
and driving modes. Please refer to&nbsp;<u>Annex B</u>&nbsp;for screenshots
of the pilot testing app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Collaboration with&nbsp;General Authority for Survey and Geospatial Information of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</em></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of SLA’s efforts
to foster international knowledge exchange and contribute our experiences
in the use of geospatial data and technology, SLA has also embarked on
its first bilateral collaboration with the&nbsp;General Authority for Survey
and Geospatial Information (GEOSA), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The collaboration
stems from both countries’ rapid urbanisation, which has seen an increasing
need to harness geospatial data and technology in decision making, as there
are&nbsp;similar challenges faced&nbsp;by&nbsp;global cities which could
benefit from shared solutions.&nbsp;The collaboration with GEOSA, which
will be over a three-year period, will entail&nbsp;exchange of knowledge
and experiences on:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>the development and management of national geospatial databases;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the use of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning
in the development of Digital Twins;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>digital transformation in the geospatial industry; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>development of geospatial products and services that will benefit citizens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Sin Lye Chong, Assistant
Chief Executive&nbsp;(Geospatial &amp; Engagement) and Chief Sustainability
Officer&nbsp;of SLA, and Mr&nbsp;Asim Ibrahim AlGhamdi, Assistant President
of GEOSA for National Geospatial Center, signed an Intent of Collaboration
at the side-lines of the Geo Connect Asia 2023.</p>
<p></p>
<p>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please refer to&nbsp;<u>Annex C</u>&nbsp;for
the quotes from the partners and the photos of the signing ceremonies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Charting out the focus on education</em></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the opening of the Geo Connect
Asia 2023, Dr Amy Khor also presented the “Distinction Award” to two winning
teams of the ASEAN Geospatial Challenge 2023, which was organised by SLA.
The annual challenge&nbsp;brings youths from the ASEAN region together
to solve real life problems using geospatial technology and information.
Please refer to&nbsp;<u>Annex D</u>&nbsp;for more information about the
challenge and the winning projects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SLA has been working with partners
to inculcate&nbsp;geospatial interest and awareness among students&nbsp;by
exciting them about the potential of geospatial technologies to solve everyday
challenges in our community.&nbsp;Other examples of such initiatives include
the annual Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) Innovation Challenge
co-organised with the Space Faculty, the&nbsp;annual&nbsp;Regional Geospatial
Youth Forum, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Young Geospatial Scientist workshop in partnership
with Singapore Science Centre. New educational initiatives for students
will be announced later this year. Through these initiatives, SLA aims
to mainstream the use of geospatial data and capabilities.
