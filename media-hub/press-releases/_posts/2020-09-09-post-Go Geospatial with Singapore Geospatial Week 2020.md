<p><strong>Singapore Geospatial Week+ 2020</strong> (#SgGeoWeek) will bring
the geospatial community together virtually for a bigger line-up of geospatial-related
events and activities. Themed “Go Geospatial”, this second edition is extended
beyond a week with over 60 webinars.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Presented by GeoWorks, Singapore’s geospatial industry
centre managed and operated by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA), Singapore
Geospatial Week+ 2020, which is happening from 7 to 18 September 2020 is
officially launched today. Anchored across four industries of focus – <em>Built &amp; Infrastructure, Mobility &amp; Logistics, Real Estate &amp; Retail, and Urban &amp; Environment,</em> this
knowledge sharing platform brings together more than 80 industry specialists
and partners as they share their vision on the future of geospatial technology,
to spur innovation across a multitude of uses from drone solutions and
Artificial Intelligence, to 3D scanning and the creation of digital twins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For the second year running, SLA also organised the <strong>Regional Geospatial Youth Forum </strong>which
was held on 8 September 2020 to generate and build geospatial interest,
awareness and a vibrant community among young professionals and students
from Singapore and various ASEAN countries and regions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Everything happens somewhere. Even when one logs
into a virtual meeting, one is doing so from somewhere. We see geospatial
technology as a key capability of a Smart Nation. Geospatial technology
has provided, and will continue to provide, innovations and solutions to
cities and countries, that help us contain the ongoing public health crisis,
and help us manage the economic and social fallout. This is why Singapore
Geospatial Week+ 2020 is an important event, for the geospatial community
to share knowledge and exchange experiences, at this time when we urgently
need to join hands and minds to solve big common problems,” said Deputy
Secretary for Smart Nation and Digital Government, Tan Kok Yam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SLA Acting Chief Executive Simon Ong said, “Geospatial
information has become an integral component in driving solutions for businesses,
the community and individuals. The current Covid-19 pandemic has led to
location-based data being leveraged on for crowd management applications
in line with safe distancing measures, thus enabling the public to make
informed decisions to protect themselves. This year, Singapore Geospatial
Week+ 2020 held on a virtual platform, will connect industry movers and
enthusiasts across borders to enable knowledge sharing across the globe.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Singapore Geospatial Week+ 2020 Highlights</em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Covid-19-themed webinars: Managing safety for the community&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A spotlight feature for Singapore Geospatial Week+
2020 is the Covid-19 webinar series, showcasing the use of geospatial solutions
to better manage public safety efforts in a pandemic. Led by industry speakers
including GeoWorks’ GeoTechs - CITYDATA, TNO, and GeoPartner Grab amongst
others, the Covid-19 webinar series will highlight the use of how geospatial
technologies are leveraged in an urban environment and integrated into
a new normal for the community.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Emphasising the role of geospatial data analytics,
CITYDATA Chief Executive Officer Apu Kumar said, “Social distancing, sheltering
and self-quarantine measures are critical to contain the spread of Covid-19
and flatten the transmission curve. Our data insights about the anonymised
movement patterns of people can provide essential inputs for government
agencies to measure the effectiveness of lockdown or stay-home policies.”&nbsp;
<br>
<br><strong><u>International knowledge sharing<br></u></strong>
<br>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>GeoInnovation from Around the World</em>is introduced
as a dialogue segment to promote geospatial sharing across borders for
industry professionals. Hosted by GeoWorks’ GeoCommunity partners from
around the globe, this knowledge sharing initiative will be led by start-ups
and agencies from around the world including Australia, Finland, Japan,
United Kingdom and the United States to build geospatial interest and expertise
sharing.&nbsp;
<br>
<br><strong><u>Geospatial data and analytics in public sector<br></u></strong>
<br>9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Geospatial data and analytics have also served as
a platform for government agencies and city planners. The public sector
sharing segment will draw focus on the use of geospatial technologies to
achieve better governance and how it has been adopted by public agencies
for land and sea planning, development of liveable cities, and even for
urban trees and greenery management.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SLA has collaborated with the National Parks Board
on the use of location-based information to drive efficiency in the management
of green spaces. Leveraging on the OneMap base map as a visualisation tool,
maintenance information is streamlined on a single platform to identify
gaps and minimise overlaps in service delivery. Featuring updated counts
and location information of trees to be maintained, this platform is also
used for service and operation planning.&nbsp;
