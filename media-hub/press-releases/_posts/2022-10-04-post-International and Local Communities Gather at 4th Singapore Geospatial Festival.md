<p><strong>Welcome Remarks by Mr Colin Low, Chief Executive, Singapore Land Authority at the Joint Opening of the Singapore Geospatial Festival 2022 &amp; the Open Geospatial Consortium Member Meeting at Lifelong Learning Institute on 4 October 2022 (Tuesday)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Dr. Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Transport
and Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment,</p>
<p>Dr. Nadine Alameh, Chief Executive Officer, Open Geospatial Consortium,</p>
<p>Mr Lam Yi Young, Chief Executive Officer, Singapore Business Federation,</p>
<p>Captain Muhammad Segar, Assistant Chief Executive, Maritime and Port Authority,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Distinguished guests,</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the joint opening of the Singapore
Geospatial Festival 2022 and the Open Geospatial Consortium Member meeting.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the national geospatial agency, the Singapore
Land Authority develops, supports, and promotes the adoption of geospatial
information, services, and technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do this not alone, but with our partners
from the public and private sector. The Singapore Geospatial Festival,
GeoFest in short, manifests this concerted effort. We have lined up an
exciting and broad-based programme filled with co-located industry events
and activities this week. Whether you are an expert or simply curious to
learn more, we welcome you to GeoFest 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>A Sustainable Future with Geospatial</u></strong>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of you might wonder why geospatial is so
critical.&nbsp; In an ever-changing world, hot button issues such as climate
change have come to the forefront of every nation’s agenda. The United
Nations (UN) is spearheading a global movement to encourage sustainability
through formulating sustainable development goals (SDGs). Through the SDGs,
the UN calls for urgent action in areas such as building sustainable cities
and initiating climate action.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We align with the UN SDGs by exploring methods
through which we can craft a more sustainable future for Singapore. Geospatial,
in fact, plays an important role in achieving this objective. Geospatial&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;be
a key enabler in our sustainability journey. To give an example, the placement
of solar panel on the roof top to tap on clean energy may sound like a
simple decision – every building has a roof! But is it truly that simple?
Few people know that there are many geospatial parameters, including roof
height, surface, facing, etc. that are critical in determining the optimal
solar panel placement to derive the maximum amount of solar power. We need
geospatial data and technology, solutions, and innovations to help us better
tackle climate change challenges.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theme for GeoFest 2022 – ‘<strong>A Sustainable Future with Geospatial</strong>’
reflects both our concerns regarding sustainability and desire to address
them. This week’s events and activities will largely focus on this issue.&nbsp;
By tapping on the expert knowledge through talks and workshops, including
the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) member meeting, we can all learn about,
or at least become aware of, how geospatial can help us&nbsp;address sustainability
challenges.</p>
<p><strong><u>Open Geospatial Consortium Member Meeting</u></strong>
</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OGC has done invaluable work around the
globe, spreading the use of geospatial for the greater good. Their decision
to hold the Member Meeting here, in conjunction with the GeoFest, spotlights
the importance of geospatial not just in Singapore but also in the APAC
region.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SLA and MPA are honoured to co-host this meeting
that sees many OGC members from different parts of the world gather here.
Their expertise and experience in geospatial standards and technology will
certainly benefit Singapore. In fact, we share a common goal with the OGC
– to work towards creating a sustainable future with geospatial. Not just
for ourselves, but for our children and future generations.</p>
<p><strong><u>Closing</u></strong>
</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build this future, we require collaboration
between all sectors.&nbsp; To this end, SLA will be signing two collaboration
MOUs this week.&nbsp; One is with the National University of Singapore’s
Centre of Nature-based Climate Solutions this Thursday, and another, with
the Singapore Business Federation, today.&nbsp; We hope the collaboration
among the public sector, the academics, and the business community will
help drive the use of geospatial for better climate and business solutions.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;In closing, I would like to thank our partners who are organising
geospatial events in conjunction with GeoFest&nbsp;–&nbsp;ESRI Singapore,
Hexagon, the National Super Computing Centre, Nvidia, the Real Estate Developers
Association of Singapore, Singapore Science Centre&nbsp;–&nbsp;just to
name a few, who all see the importance of making the GeoFest an anchor
geospatial industry event in Singapore.&nbsp; We hope this concerted effort
will grow in strength and spread the message of the power of geospatial
information and technology.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;Lastly, I hope that you will find the events lined up this week
enriching and inspiring. I wish all of you an enjoyable time at GeoFest
2022.&nbsp;Thank you.</p>

<p>Chief Executive of Singapore Land Authority, Mr Colin Low (right) and
Chief Executive Officer of Singapore Business Federation, Mr Lam Yi Young
(left) signed a&nbsp;new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)&nbsp;on 4 October,&nbsp;to
harness the potential of geospatial applications across industries. The
MOU signing was witnessed by&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor (centre), Senior Minister
of State, Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, and Ministry
of Transport.</p>
<p>“SBF is pleased to be collaborating with SLA to help companies better
appreciate the use of geospatial technologies and services in their businesses.&nbsp;Companies
in sectors such as waste management, logistics, landscaping, retail and
F&amp;B, can potentially benefit from the use of such technologies in their
operations to improve productivity and reach out to their customers. SBF
will partner SLA and other trade associations and chambers (TACs) to share
about the solutions companies can adopt or co-develop with solution providers
to maximise their business opportunities.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lam Yi Young, Chief Executive
Officer of SBF</p>
<p>&nbsp;“SLA is already working with companies which are interested to tap
on geospatial data to optimise last-mile deliveries which indirectly reduces
carbon footprint by cutting traveling time, or using it in construction
to mitigate flood risks. The partnership with SBF will provide a springboard
to share such insights with more businesses so that they can start to appreciate
geospatial data and technologies and learn to apply them to transform or
improve their business operations and service delivery. The MOU with SBF
is an important step in that direction. We are excited to work closely
with SBF to help our local businesses to think about, and eventually adopt
geospatial data and technologies in ways that will benefit them.”</p>

</p>
<p><strong><a class="" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Pilot project to&nbsp;</a>develop prototypes and enhance&nbsp;open standards for integrating various types of land and marine data</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of continuous innovation efforts, the Singapore Land Authority
(SLA) and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) will collaborate
with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) on a pilot project, known as
“the Open Geospatial Consortium - International Hydrographic Organisation
- International Standards Organisation Federated Marine Spatial Data Infrastructure
(OGC-IHO-ISO FMSDI) Pilot Project Phase V”. The pilot project aims to develop
application prototypes and enhance open standards for integrating various
types of land and marine data.</p>
<p><em>Rationale for the collaboration</em>
</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like many island
countries, Singapore faces climate change impacts such as rising sea levels,
projected increased frequency and intensity of storm surges and rainfall.
The use of relevant technologies and the integration of land and marine
data, especially at the coastal zone, is critical to Singapore’s resilience,
for instance through proactive planning and decision-making for coastal
and port infrastructure protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, there
are various international and national standards being used to record and
access land&nbsp;and marine data, as well as cadastral, sensor, and statistical
data, with the National Marine Spatial Data Infrastructures like Singapore’s
GeoSpace-Sea. Through prototyping, the pilot project will test out how
these various standardised data can be applied with technologies such as
digital twins and application programming interfaces, to visualise, and
if need be, inform the enhancement of existing open standards.</p>
<p><em>Scope</em>
</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project&nbsp;will
seek to produce a practical definition of digital twins in Singapore’s
context and see the development of application prototypes using open standards
that can serve as a case study for global implementation in future. The
co-development of the open standards for integrating land and marine data
will also pave the way to the development of a digital twin that integrates
land and sea in Singapore to facilitate coastal protection, marine and
coastal spatial planning, critical infrastructure protection and resilience.</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Captain&nbsp;Muhammad&nbsp;Segar,
Assistant Chief Executive (Operations), said, “The ability to integrate
land and marine data will better support decision making for coastal and
port infrastructure planning and development. MPA is excited to partner
SLA and OGC on a pilot to develop open standards for integrating various
types of land and marine data and application prototypes based on those
standards, including digital twin technologies.”</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Colin Low,
Chief Executive of SLA, said, “Singapore takes climate change seriously
and we have seen the global impact of climate change faced by other countries.
At SLA, we are supporting the global efforts to address climate change
challenges by tapping on geospatial technologies and working with our partners
on appropriate solutions.&nbsp; We are happy to partner OGC which is highly
regarded for its open standards development work, and MPA which has been
playing an important role in environmental protection in this pilot project.&nbsp;
Through the project, we hope to build up a more robust repository of land
and marine data that will help us in enabling better solutions in protecting
our coastlines.&nbsp; Beyond Singapore, the findings from the project will
benefit other countries which are also looking at using land and marine
data for their coastal protection planning strategies.”</p>
