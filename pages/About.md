<p>Singapore's National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) was set up in
2008. Previously known as the Singapore Geospatial Collaborative Environment
or SG-SPACE, the NSDI provides a mechanism to make authoritative geospatial
data available for decision-making, public security and cost-effective
businesses.</p>
<p>In 2018, SG-SPACE was reconceptualized to Geospatial Singapore (GeospatialSG),
signifying the whole-of-nation approach to collectively maximize the use
of geospatial information and technology for Singapore's social and economic
development.</p>
