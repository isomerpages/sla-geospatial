<h2>Singapore Geospatial <strong>Master Plan</strong></h2>
<p>The Singapore Geospatial Master Plan drives Singapore’s national geospatial
development, maximising the impact of geospatial information and technology
for the economy and the wider society.</p>
<p>The latest iteration, published in 2024, is co-driven by the Singapore
Land Authority (SLA) and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA).
It is a collaborative and visionary undertaking, bringing together both
the land and sea towards transforming Singapore into ‘A Leading Global
Geospatial Hub’. This will be done via the three following strategies:</p>
<hr>
<h4>Mainstreaming</h4>
<p>Maximising the potential of geospatial by embedding its adoption in mainstream
society. Target sectors include the social, healthcare, and economic sectors,
with initiatives promoting inclusivity, preventive healthcare and innovation.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Deepening Capabilities</h4>
<p>Enhancing core geospatial capabilities to address increasing demand. This
includes strengthening data infrastructure, fostering innovation and building
education pathways and talent pipelines.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Going Global</h4>
<p>Positioning Singapore as a leading geospatial player through international
engagements, partnerships, and events. Initiatives include contributing
to global geospatial development, strengthening partnerships and hosting
flagship geospatial conferences and events.</p>
