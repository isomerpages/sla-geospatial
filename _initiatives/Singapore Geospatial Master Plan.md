<h2>Singapore Geospatial <strong>Master Plan</strong></h2>
<p>The Singapore Geospatial Master Plan drives Singapore’s national geospatial
development, maximising the impact of geospatial information and technology
for the economy and the wider society.</p>
<p>The latest iteration, published in 2024, is co-driven by the Singapore
Land Authority (SLA) and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA).
It is a collaborative and visionary undertaking, bringing together both
the land and sea towards transforming Singapore into ‘A Leading Global
Geospatial Hub’. This will be done via the three following strategies:</p>
<hr>
<h4>Mainstreaming</h4>
<p>Maximising the potential of geospatial by embedding its adoption in mainstream
society. Target sectors incluide the social, healthcare, and economic sectors,
with initiatives promoting inclusivity, preventive healthcare and innovation.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Deepening Capabilities</h4>
<p>Geospatial capabilities across both the public and private sector will
be enhanced to address and meet the burgeoning demand for geospatial information
and technology.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Going Global</h4>
<p>Singapore will cement its position as a leading geospatial player by expanding
its global reach via international engagements, partnerships, and events.</p>
