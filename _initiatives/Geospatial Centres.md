<h2>Geospatial Trusted Centre</h2>
<p>As part of the Government Data Architecture overseen by the Smart Nation
Group, the Geospatial Trusted Centre was established in 2019 to support
the designation, implementation, distribution, and use of geospatial core
data across the public sector. The Geospatial Trusted Centre facilitates
the efficient data sharing of authoritative geospatial datasets from Single
Sources of Truth across public agencies. Along with the Trusted Centres
in the Individual &amp; Business and Sensor domains, the Geospatial Trusted
Centre is fundamental to the public sector’s efforts to become ‘data-driven
to the core’.</p>
