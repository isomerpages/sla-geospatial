<h2>Centre of Geospatial and Geomatics (C2G)</h2>
<p>Geospatial and geomatics have matured into strategic capabilities needed
to support multiple critical government functions. The Centre of Geospatial
and Geomatics (C2G) will establish Singapore as a leading centre for the
development of geospatial and geomatics capabilities. C2G will build key
expertise and skillsets, ensuring that Singapore’s ability to use geospatial
and geomatics for national functions will be sustainable in the long run.
Initiatives driven by the C2G will encompass both the upstream functions
of geomatics survey and mapping, as well as downstream geospatial capabilities
and services.</p>
